> remember that your prospects get to decide who your competitors are—you can’t decide for them


> You’re attempting to craft a positioning where you are less interchangeable so that withholding your expertise has some practical impact. That’s the only power you have in a professional service context: to **withhold your expertise**.


> Too few options and your positioning is likely not viable. Too many and you’re easily replaced with no pricing power.


> As you work out the intricacies of the positioning journey, there are two forces that slow your progress: one good (**lack of opportunity**) and one bad (**lack of courage**).

For an expert within the professional services sector, **the appropriate number of competitors is 10–200** and **the appropriate number of prospects is 2,000–10,000**.

Ojo acá con lo siguiente:


> If you can’t find enough competitors who will occupy the same expert positioning that you intend to, the largest danger is that it might not be viable.


> if you find experts who already occupy your presumed new focus. It means that what you are considering is viable! It’s great news!


> If you don’t find anyone, you’re either the smartest, most courageous, or richest person with that idea(…) that idea didn’t have any legs

# Lecciones de Philip Morgan
Philip Morgan es experto en posicionamiento. Por sus correos tomé la decisión de volver el tablero de Trello “Auto Estudio” en más estudio de temas de negocio y empresa y menos de aspectos técnicos. Al final de cuentas ya tengo una base de programación con la cual trabajar. Ahora necesito hallar clientes.

Esta frase dice mucho para mí:

> I huge part of being successfully self-employed is deciding you are going to be a business owner first and an engineer (or artist) second. The two can co-exist, but it takes some soul-searching.

**Positioning is how you differentiate your business from commodity competition**.

## Commodity Generalist
> A commodity good or service has full or partial but substantial fungibility; that is, the market treats its instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. Wikipedia.

If your services are treated as a commodity, that means your clients view them as mostly or completely *interchangeable* with other similar services.


> Citing Wikipedia again here:
> 
> When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it. The classic example is the telephone. The more people who own telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner.
> 
> Skills like knowledge of a particular programming language work the exact opposite way. The more widely held that skill is, the less expensive it is. Sure, there will be exceptions and edge cases. Even Cobol devs and people with mainframe skills got a temporary respite from this fate in 1999.
> 
> However, if there are no artificial barriers to entry, the general trend is towards the spread of formerly specialized knowledge and a corresponding reduction in the value of that knowledge. That's how commoditization works.

*Commoditization is usually great for consumers of products and services, and not so great for small suppliers who can't operate at the scale necessary to profit in a commodity market.*

**Cuando se trabaja como freelance sin enfocarse en una industria(mi situación actual)**

A generalist freelancer is *constantly multitasking* in ways that prevent them from developing the ability to charge premium rates.

## Posicionamiento

Positioning fundamentally means defining a clear focus for your business. You can focus on a type of client, a problem you solve for them, or both.

**Marketing cuando se sabe a quién le ofertamos los servicios**

- Marketing will become *easier* after you define a focus for your business.
- When you know *who* your business is focused on serving, you know where and how to reach your potential clients with a marketing message.
- When you know *what* your best clients struggle with and how that most profitably overlaps with your skills, you know what marketing content to put in front of them.
- And when you know those two things *(where/how to reach clients, and what to say to them*), you **have the building blocks of a good marketing strategy**. The rest is details. Important details, for sure, but still it's details.

Philip habla sobre posicionamiento horizontal(trabajar en muchas industrias) y posicionamiento vertical(trabajar en una industria o niche de mercado).

Ejemplos de estar horizontalmente:

- PostgreSQL database performance tuning and optimization (this is the one shown in the picture above)
- Lead generation specialist
- Public speaking coach
- SEO consultant


> The horizontal market position makes it harder to find clients, which makes it harder to market to them. Furthermore, whatever problem forms the foundation of your horizontal position has to be a really painful, urgent, or important problem, otherwise it won't motivate potential clients enough for them to seek you out.

Ejemplos de estar verticalmente:

- Custom web apps for transportation companies
- Marketing for yoga studios
- SEO for construction companies (this is the one shown in the picture above)
- Mobile app development for credit unions

**Las ventajas de ir por un mercado vertical**

Ventaja de mercadeo

> The marketing advantage of specialization is that finally, you know who you are trying to reach and what you are trying to say to them! It's such a struggle to know these things if you're an un-focused generalist, but once you choose and commit to a tightly-focused market, your mind becomes flooded with ideas for how to find and connect and build trust with buyers.

Ventaja de experticia

> The expertise advantage of specialization is that, over time, less of your value becomes knowing how to use version x.yz of a given piece of technology and more of your value becomes helping your clients move the needle using technology.

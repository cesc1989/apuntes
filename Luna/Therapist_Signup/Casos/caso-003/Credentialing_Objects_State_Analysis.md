# Credentialing Objects State Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of possible states two Credentialing objects could end up in during the ExtendedSignUpWorker process.

## Initial State
- **First object**: "Active Attested" label
- **Second object**: doesn't exist yet

## ExtendedSignUpWorker Process Steps
1. Create new credentialing object
2. Change first object from "Active Attested" to "Active" 
3. Remove "Active Attested" label from first object
4. Associate second object with "Active Attested" label

## Possible End States

### 1. **Complete Success** (Ideal)
- **First object**: "Active" label only
- **Second object**: "Active Attested" label
- **Result**: ✅ Correct state

### 2. **Step 3 Fails** (remove "Active Attested" from first object)
- **First object**: "Active" + "Active Attested" labels
- **Second object**: "Active Attested" label  
- **Result**: ❌ Both objects have "Active Attested"

### 3. **Step 2 Fails** (can't add "Active" to first object)
- **First object**: "Active Attested" label only
- **Second object**: "Active Attested" label
- **Result**: ❌ Both objects have "Active Attested"

### 4. **Step 4 Fails** (can't associate second object)
- **First object**: "Active" label only
- **Second object**: no association labels
- **Result**: ❌ No object has "Active Attested"

### 5. **Steps 1&4 Succeed, Steps 2&3 Fail**
- **First object**: "Active Attested" label only
- **Second object**: "Active Attested" label
- **Result**: ❌ Both objects have "Active Attested"

### 6. **Partial Failures Creating Dual Labels**
- **First object**: Both "Active" and "Active Attested" labels
- **Second object**: "Active Attested" label
- **Result**: ❌ Inconsistent state with dual labels

## Key Insight
There are multiple failure scenarios where **both objects end up with "Active Attested" labels**, which would violate the business rule that only one credentialing object should have the "Active Attested" status at any time.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Steps 2, 3, and 5 create dual "Active Attested" scenarios
- **Medium Risk**: Step 6 creates inconsistent dual-label states
- **Low Risk**: Step 4 leaves system without any "Active Attested" object

## Recommendations
1. Implement atomic transactions for label changes
2. Add rollback mechanisms for failed operations
3. Validate final state before committing changes
4. Consider implementing a cleanup job to detect and fix inconsistent states

## Real-World Case Analysis - July 4, 2025

### Observed Issue
- **Correct Object ID**: 30278823850 (should be "Active")
- **Incorrect Object ID**: 30272441773 (incorrectly labeled "Active")

### Timeline from Logs

#### 01:31:40 - Object 30278823850 (Correct)
- `credentialing_active_attested_id` set to **30278823850**
- Initial creation/assignment

#### 07:04:56 - Object 30278823850 (Correct) 
- `credentialing_hubspot_id` set to **30278823850**
- "Active Attested" → "Active" transition

#### 07:04:57 - Object 30272441773 (Incorrect) - **1 second later**
- `credentialing_active_attested_id` set to **30272441773** 
- New object creation overwrites previous value

#### 07:22:44 - Object 30272441773 (Incorrect)
- `credentialing_hubspot_id` set to **30272441773**
- This object also received "Active" label

#### 07:46:38 - Object 30278823850 (Correct)
- `credentialing_hubspot_id` set back to **30278823850**

### Key Findings

1. **Race Condition**: Objects processed within 1 second (07:04:56 vs 07:04:57)
2. **Duplicate Processing**: Both objects received `credentialing_hubspot_id` assignments
3. **Multiple Worker Runs**: ExtendedSignUpWorker likely executed multiple times for same therapist
4. **Dual "Active" Labels**: Both objects ended up with "Active" status

### Root Cause
**Race condition or duplicate job execution** where ExtendedSignUpWorker processed the same therapist multiple times, creating multiple credentialing objects that both received "Active" labels.

### Additional Recommendations
5. Implement job deduplication for ExtendedSignUpWorker
6. Add therapist-level locking during credentialing object processing
7. Validate no existing active jobs before starting new ExtendedSignUpWorker
8. Add monitoring for rapid successive credentialing object updates

# Progress Form not created after Copy Form feature usage after Care Plane cloned

> Looking at the manage forms link, the intake form was completed at 05/29 and _was copied from care plan 1 to care plan 2 (due to injury type change)_. However, the Progress Form which should have become available (and incomplete/blank) after visit #4 (06/09/24) is not present.

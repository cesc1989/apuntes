# Progress Form not loading after Copy

ID: `b0575c6f-bf27-4b51-b1f5-cdfb2c9706ad`

> Looking at the manage forms link, the intake form was completed at 05/29 and _was copied from care plan 1 to care plan 2 (due to injury type change)_. However, the Progress Form which should have become available (and incomplete/blank) after visit #4 (06/09/24) is not present.

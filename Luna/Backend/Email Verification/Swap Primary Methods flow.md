We want to split the landing page (`app/views/user_communication_methods/email_verifications/new.html.haml`) into two different pages:
- `email_verifications/verified`
- `email_verifications/unverified`

But to do this first I have to understand this snippet in the controller:
```ruby
def new
	@communication_method.verify!(@code) if @communication_method.present? && @code.present?

	# For patients, handle the case where the email address has changed. Once they verify the
	# new email address, we want to switch the newly verified one to be the primary method.
	user = @communication_method&.user
	swap_primary_methods(@communication_method) if user.is_a?(Account) && user.patient?
rescue *ERRORS => e
	ExceptionLogger.log(e, "Error verifying email: #{e}")
end
```

With the two different landing pages, by bringing the conditional from the view:
```ruby
# email_verifications/new.html.erb

if @communication_method&.verified?
  # verified
elsif @communication_method&.verification_code != @code || @communication_method&.expired_verification_code?
  # invalid or expired
else
  # error
end
```

the controller would look like this:
```ruby
def new
  if @communication_method&.verified?
    redirect_to email_verifications_verified_path(@communication_method)
  elsif @communication_method&.verification_code != @code || @communication_method&.expired_verification_code?
    redirect_to email_verifications_unverified_path(@communication_method)
  else
    render :error_page
  end

  user = @communication_method&.user
  swap_primary_methods(@communication_method) if user.is_a?(Account) && user.patient?
end
```

Would this work? ~~No. The redirect or render will finish the action leaving the final part unexecuted. For it to work, I'd need to call the `swap_primary_methods` in every conditional so that it gets executed wherever it falls.~~

It should work. Did a test in a test application and it executed the code in the end always.

## Example Controller

Wrote this controller:
```ruby
class VerificationsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    verified = params[:result]

    if verified == "ok"
      redirect_to success_verifications_path
    elsif verified == "failure"
      redirect_to failure_verifications_path
    else
      redirect_to error_verifications_path
    end

    ap "Hola mundo cruel\nAqui estoys"
  end
end

```

The puts happens always regardless of the redirect. Rails executes all of the code in the controller and in the end it makes the redirect:
```bash

Completed 200 OK in 14ms (Views: 13.1ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Allocations: 8760)
```

In this log we can see it does everything in the controller action and afterwards it goes to the redirected page.

# Test swap_primary_method executes for Patient UCM

I need to find a UCM for a Patient. It's a bit complicated because the relationship between UCM and Patient is not that clear.

I need to:

- Find a Patient
- Access its Account
- Access the account EmailAddress association
	- Can be nil in some instances

So the best way is to write an SQL query to get UCM for the joined models or Join them using ActiveRecord:
```ruby
p1 = Patient.joins(account: :email_address)
p1.account.email_address

Account Load (138.5ms)  SELECT "accounts".* FROM "accounts" WHERE "accounts"."id" = $1 LIMIT $2  [["id", "00011668-e636-4dbb-8353-daa33ed13cac"], ["LIMIT", 1]]
  UserCommunicationMethod Load (139.4ms)  SELECT "user_communication_methods".* FROM "user_communication_methods" WHERE "user_communication_methods"."user_id" = $1 AND "user_communication_methods"."user_type" = $2 AND "user_communication_methods"."kind" = $3 AND "user_communication_methods"."primary_method" = $4 ORDER BY "user_communication_methods"."created_at" DESC LIMIT $5  [["user_id", "00011668-e636-4dbb-8353-daa33ed13cac"], ["user_type", "Account"], ["kind", 0], ["primary_method", true], ["LIMIT", 1]]

=> #<UserCommunicationMethod:0x0000000149355d00
 id: "1ae92f71-6454-42c2-b64c-8373a272709c",
 user_type: "Account",
 user_id: "00011668-e636-4dbb-8353-daa33ed13cac",
 primary_method: true,
 verification_status: "verification_disabled",
 kind: "email",
 value: "demo+1719348736131@koombea.com",
 verification_code: nil,
 verification_code_expires_at: nil,
 verification_sent_at: nil,
 verified_at: nil,
 verification_attempts: 0,
 created_at: Tue, 25 Jun 2024 13:52:29.738954000 PDT -07:00,
 updated_at: Tue, 25 Jun 2024 13:52:29.738954000 PDT -07:00>
```

Why is `verification_status: "verification_disabled"`?

Let's try to test the swap_primary_method flow.
```ruby
ucm = UserCommunicationMethod.find("1ae92f71-6454-42c2-b64c-8373a272709c")
ucm.update!(verification_code: SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(16))

Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.verify_email_url(
  UserCommunicationMethods::Email.encode_url_token(ucm),
  host: ENV.fetch("ROOT_URL"),
  protocol: Luna.env_protocol,
  port: ENV["APPLICATION_PORT"]
)
```

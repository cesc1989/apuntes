# ðŸŽ‰ You tried to define an enum named "status" on the model but this will generate a instance method "frozen?", which is already defined by Active Record ðŸŽ‰

This error:

# ./app/models/invoicing_target.rb:17:in `<class:InvoicingTarget>'
# ./app/models/invoicing_target.rb:4:in `<top (required)>'
```

This error happens in the `InvoicingTarget` model because it defines a `frozen` status which is not valid.
```ruby
enum status: {
    # No invoicing attempts have been made; target changes are allowed
    draft: 0,
    # No invoicing attempts have been made; target changes are NOT allowed
    frozen: 1,
```

This is because `stateful_enum` generates methods from the keys. So it will generate a `frozen?` method which is [already defined by ActiveRecord](https://apidock.com/rails/v7.0.0/ActiveRecord/Core/ClassMethods/frozen%3F)

See also similar issue report -> https://github.com/amatsuda/stateful_enum/issues/25

## The Fix ðŸ©¹

To fix this, either change the word `frozen` in the enum or [add a prefix/suffix](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.4/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html).

# Your bundle is locked to mutex_m (0.3.0) from rubygems repository

```
Your bundle is locked to mutex_m (0.3.0) from rubygems repository
https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally, but that version can no longer be
found in that source. That means the author of mutex_m (0.3.0) has removed it.
You'll need to update your bundle to a version other than mutex_m (0.3.0) that
hasn't been removed in order to install.
```

This error went away without me doing anything.

# ArgumentError for ActiveRecord-Import gem

This error in tests:

```bash
 1) TherapistBadges achieved badges should return only the correct achieved badge of each type
     Failure/Error:
       NotificationSetting.kinds.each_key
         .map { |kind| { account_id: id, kind: kind, communication_methods: ["push"], enabled: true } }
         .then { |settings| NotificationSetting.import(settings, on_duplicate_key_ignore: true) }

     ArgumentError:

     # ./app/models/therapist.rb:1223:in `set_notification_setting_defaults'
```

## The Fix ðŸ©¹

Fixed by upgrading activerecord-import gem to 1.5.0.

# undefined method table_name for ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration:Class

This:

     NoMethodError:

               ::ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration.table_name
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^

```

The first search results pointed to Ransack but ActiveAdmin was already upgraded to version 3.1.0 and so Ransack is upgraded as well to a version that fixes it.

Ransack repo links:
- Issue: https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/issues/1444
- Release of 4.2.1 https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/releases/tag/v4.2.1

Gemfile status
```
# Gemfile.lock
ransack (4.2.1)
      activerecord (>= 6.1.5)
      activesupport (>= 6.1.5)
      i18n

# Gemfile
gem "activeadmin", "3.1.0"
```

So I read more the log and it looks like to be database-cleaner.

## The Fix ðŸ©¹

The fix is to upgrade gem to database_cleaner-active_record to 2.1.0 as [mentioned](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner-active_record/issues/83#issuecomment-1464759691).

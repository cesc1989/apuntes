```

This error happens in the `InvoicingTarget` model because it defines a `frozen` status which is not valid.
```ruby
enum status: {
    # No invoicing attempts have been made; target changes are allowed
    draft: 0,
    # No invoicing attempts have been made; target changes are NOT allowed
    frozen: 1,
```

This is because `stateful_enum` generates methods from the keys. So it will generate a `frozen?` method which is [already defined by ActiveRecord](https://apidock.com/rails/v7.0.0/ActiveRecord/Core/ClassMethods/frozen%3F)

People often start pieces somewhere sensible, but boring. Like the chronological start of a story.

The beginning is almost never the most compelling or important part. It's just the bit you thought of first,

Another ==bad way to start a piece of writing is with a statement of what you're going to write about==, followed by a definition.

You can't write good openings without having good ideas, good arguments, good structure, and good storytelling skills.

## Tense, Paradoxical, and Problematic Openings

**Openings need tension – paradoxes, unanswered questions, and unresolved action.**

Good ==openings propose problems, pose questions, drop you into an unfinished story==, or point at fundamental tensions within a topic.

(...) sets up a clear paradox: *our technological advances should have led to fewer working hours, but they haven't. Strange*.

(...) asks a series of rhetorical questions to which the presumed answers is “of course not!”

## Finding Tension, Paradoxes and Problems

it is more of a failure to pose an uninteresting problem, than to poorly articulate an interesting one.

Your **urge to write about the thing hopefully comes from a place of curiosity**.

Problems are a **destabilising condition** that has a **cost** for a **community of readers** that needs a **solution**.

> a problem is an expected turn of events, that has undesireable consequences, ==for an audience who will care about it, that we want to explore solutions to==.

Aquí lo que viene a decir la autora es que nuestro texto o exposición debe plantear una solución a un problema que una persona/comunidad padece y al cual le buscan una solución.

## Consequential Problems

(...) suggests we try to state our problem and then ask a series of so what?'s to get at the underlying problem.

> For your writing to be worth reading, you need to be exploring something of consequence for someone. ==You have to have some kind of problem that matters==. Even if it's a personal problem like a medical issue, career challenge, or difficult technical bug, **you're hopefully writing about it to help others encountering a similar situation**.

Esto es como lo que yo trato de hacer en mi blog personal. Escribiendo para narrar mis dificultades y cómo las resolví. Esperando que algún día alguien le sirvan también.

## Starting in the Middle 

Developing a structure requires navigating the tension between chronology and theme.

Live conference talk audiences are trapped in a way reading audiences are not. (...) give them more explanation of where my story is going and why it's worth their valuable attention.

You should ==make The Point clear as soon as possible==.

Here are two of the opening slides from my  talk:

This outline isn't especially detailed, but now the audience has a map of where we're going. They understand the structure of my argument and can tell what I am and am not going to cover.

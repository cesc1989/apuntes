# Cap. 18 - Code should be obvious

> Obscurity occurs when important information about a system is not obvious to new developers.


> If code is obvious, it means that someone can read the code quickly, without much thought, and their first guesses about the behavior or meaning of the code will be correct.


> Obvious code needs fewer comments than nonobvious code.


> If a name is vague or ambiguous, then readers will have to read through the code in order to deduce the meaning of the named entity; this is time-consuming and error-prone.


> If similar things are always done in similar ways, then readers can recognize patterns they have seen before and immediately draw (safe) conclusions without analyzing the code in detail.


> Sometimes it isn’t possible to avoid code that is nonobvious. When this happens, it’s important to use comments to compensate by providing the missing information.

**IMPORTANTE**


> **software should be designed for ease of reading, not ease of writing.** Generic containers are expedient for the person writing the code, but they create confusion for all the readers that follow.


> Code is most obvious if it conforms to the conventions that readers will be expecting; if it doesn’t, then it’s important to document the behavior so readers aren’t confused.

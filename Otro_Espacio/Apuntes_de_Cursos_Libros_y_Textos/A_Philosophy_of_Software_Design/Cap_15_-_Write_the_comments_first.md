# Cap. 15 - Write the comments first

> The best time to write comments is at the beginning of the process, as you write the code. Writing the comments first makes documentation part of the design process.


> delaying documentation often means that it never gets written at all. Once you start delaying, it’s easy to delay a bit more; after all, the code will be even more stable in a few more weeks.


> To write a good comment, you must identify the essence of a variable or piece of code: what are the most important aspects of this thing? It’s important to do this early in the design process; otherwise you are just hacking code.


> If the interface comment for a method provides all the information needed to use the method and is also short and simple, that indicates that the method has a simple interface.


> Conversely, if there’s no way to describe a method completely without a long and complicated comment, then the method has a complex interface.

# Cap. 17 - Consistency

> If a system is consistent, it means that similar things are done in similar ways, and dissimilar things are done in different ways.


> Consistency creates cognitive leverage: once you have learned how something is done in one place, you can use that knowledge to immediately understand other places that use the same approach.


## Examples of consistency
- Names
- Coding Style
- Interfaces
- Design Patterns
- Invariants: an invarian is a property of a variable that is always true.

**When in Rome, do as the Romans do**

> When you see anything that looks like it might possibly be a convention, follow it. When making a design decision, ask yourself if it’s likely that a similar decision was made elsewhere in the project;

**Don’t change existing conventions**

> Having a “better idea” is not a sufficient excuse to introduce inconsistencies. Your new idea may indeed be better, but the value of consistency over inconsistency is almost always greater than the value of one approach over another.

Tratar de cambiar las convenciones en uso es no hacer buen uso del tiempo del equipo.

> Overall, reconsidering established conventions is rarely a good use of developer time.


----------


> Consistency means not only that similar things should be done in similar ways, but that dissimilar things should be done in different ways.


> Consistency only provides benefits when developers have confidence that “if it looks like an x, it really is an x.”

# Cap. 19 - Software Trends

## Agile Development
> The best way to end up with a good design is to develop a system in increments, where each increment adds a few new abstractions and refactors existing abstractions based on experience. This is similar to the agile development approach.

Ojo

> Developing incrementally is generally a good idea, but the increments of development should be abstractions, not features. It’s fine to put off all thoughts about a particular abstraction until it’s needed by a feature. Once you need the abstraction, invest the time to design it cleanly;


## Test-driven development
> The problem with test-driven development is that it focuses attention on getting specific features working, rather than finding the best design. This is tactical programming pure and simple, with all of its disadvantages.


## Design patterns
> Design patterns represent an alternative to design: rather than designing a new mechanism from scratch, just apply a well-known design pattern. For the most part, this is good: design patterns arose because they solve common problems, and because they are generally agreed to provide clean solutions.


> The greatest risk with design patterns is over-application. Not every problem can be solved cleanly with an existing design pattern; don’t try to force a problem into a design pattern when a custom approach will be cleaner. Using design patterns doesn’t automatically improve a software system; it only does so if the design patterns fit.

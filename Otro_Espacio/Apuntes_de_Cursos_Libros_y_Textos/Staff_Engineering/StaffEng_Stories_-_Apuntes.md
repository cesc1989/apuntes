# StaffEng Stories - Apuntes

# Michelle Bu - Payments Products Tech Lead at Stripe
> I manage two engineers who embed into high priority areas.

Un poco de labor de manager pero con muy pocas personas a cargo.


> Broad-scoped engineers create impact by working on vague, cross-organizational projects. They tend to accumulate a lot of context across many different domains and play a support role in many projects across the org.

¿podría este ser mi caso en Luna?


> Finding energizing work is what has kept me at Stripe for so long, pursuing impactful work.

En el caso de Luna me estaba faltando una dosis de eso. Creo que la llegada de Jason ha cambiado eso a mí favor.


> I measure my impact based on their progress and more importantly, the directionality of that progress and the alignment of their work to the company’s goals.


> scaling my own impact by disseminating useful mental models and ideas.


> people looked to me to have an opinion and to support their ideas!


> I spend less time advocating for specific technologies or programs and more time empowering others to advocate for the technologies and programs that they think are important.


> An **important part of making this work was writing everything down**.

Importante seguir escribiendo spikes y planes técnicos.


> took everyone’s feedback and questions very seriously and put the burden of proof on ourselves.



> I strongly believe that as long as I'm being thoughtful about my technical gaps, about filling in those gaps for the projects I'm working on, and about challenging myself with projects that take me outside of my technical comfort zone, I can build up and practice my technical skills organically.

Como los retos que encontré al meterme más y más en Luxe y en Marketplace. Eso me ayudará a desarrollar mis habilidades en varios tipos de proyectos.


> important criteria for Staff-plus Engineers in product: not to just build something that ships, but for it to roll out smoothly and continue to succeed and grow over time with as few regrettable choices as possible.

Lo más importante es enviar a prod Y que eso funcione con los menores percances posibles.


> at the time I didn’t really understand how to write my self-reviews the right way.

¿Qué son las self-reviews?


> To reach the Staff level of impact as an engineer on a UI team, you need to be able to create leverage. You could do this by building well-designed component libraries, experimentation frameworks
# Bert Fan - Senior Staff Engineer at Slack
> Staff-plus engineers are often the tech leads of projects, which means that they help write the tech spec, get feedback from various stakeholders, work closely with design and product to decide what to build, and lead the technical implementation for the project.


> You can learn a lot about the current state of engineering if you take the time to develop relationships where engineers feel like they can be honest with you.


> Develop a relationship with your manager where they implicitly trust you and you implicitly trust them.
> 
> Because your manager trusts you, when they hear about projects that will have a significant impact for the company, they will advocate for you to lead those projects.

Clave esto aquí al trabajar con Jason.


> job as a Staff Engineer, you’re likely going to spend a lot of your time talking to people.


> try to become the engineer that people want to work with.
# Duretti Hirpa - Formerly Staff Engineer at Mailchimp
> It is one of my stronger beliefs that a good leader is a kin to a good host: it’s about making room for others, making them feel welcome. If we want to grow as leaders, we need to learn to get out of the way of the people we lead, and give them a chance to participate.


> I’ll also work on cross-org initiatives. It’s a lot of relationship building, lots of getting to know people, and being known


> The job isn’t computer anymore, as I’m fond of saying. You’re now an agent of the organization, and you have to take a longer view.


# Adam Bender - Principal Software Engineer at Google
> I have to spend a lot of time writing - writing docs about our strategy, writing docs about values, and of course docs about system designs.

Una vez más, práctica escribir spikes y planes técnicos.


> you can really scale your own impact if you can get better at written communication.


> I'm convinced that being a compelling and clear communicator is a powerful skill that can increase the impact of the work you do.

Justo como lo que aboga Basecamp. Lo que veo en DHH y Jorge Manrubia.


> If I hadn't challenged myself to approach leadership, technical decision making, or planning differently, I don't think I would have been able to get to Staff.


# Ryan Bergman - Senior Staff Engineer at John Deere
> Even if I get nothing of my own done, unblocking 5 different teams to get their work done is always worth it.


> You need to be very technically capable but you also need to be someone people want to work with.

Un balance entre saber hacer y saber ayudar.


> how to run a public meeting

Algo que puedo practicar en las reuniones con Fabricio, aprender de Jason y en los meetups.


> I've been programming professionally for 20 years and at different times I've had Perl, ColdFusion, PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Scala all be the primary world I lived in. Nothing is a hammer and nothing won't eventually be replaced

En Luna he escrito:

    - Ruby
    - JavaScript
    - Python

Falta agregarle Elixir.


> Once you're at the staff engineering level you need to understand the deep relationships that every part of your org's tech stack has on each other and on the outside world!

Similar al entendimiento que tengo de los tres proyectos, además de Luxe y Marketplace

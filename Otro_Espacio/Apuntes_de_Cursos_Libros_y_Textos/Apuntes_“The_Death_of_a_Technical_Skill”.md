# Apuntes “The Death of a Technical Skill”

**Abstract**

> In 2010, Steve Jobs announced that Apple would no longer support Adobe Flash—a popular set of tools for creating Internet applications. After the announcement, the use of Flash declined precipitously.
> We show there was no reduction in Flash hourly wages because of a rapid supply response: Flash specialists, especially those who were younger, were less specialized, or had good “fall back” skills quickly transitioned away from Flash; new market entrants also avoided Flash, leaving the effective supply per Flash job opening unchanged. As such, there was no factor market reason for firms to stay with Flash longer.


# Introducción

When the demand for a skill falls—or will foreseeable fall—workers with that skill must make a choice. If they choose to “exit,” they can leave the workforce, learn a new skill, or work with another skill they already possess. If they choose to stay, they face the lower wages or worsened job-finding probability this choice entails. Workers who are entering the labor market—but disposed to working with the declining skill—have to make an analogous decision.

**Importante**
The decline in demand for Flash skills is widely attributed not to the emergence of a superior technology, but rather to a business decision made by Apple. On April 29th, 2010, Steve Jobs—the CEO of Apple at the time—published an open letter entitled *“Thoughts on Flash” (TOF)*, which announced that Apple would no longer support Flash on iOS devices such as the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

We find evidence that workers specializing in Flash prior to TOF increased their job search intensity—submitting more applications per month. 

We find strong evidence that they began moving away from their existing skill focus, applying to jobs that were less like jobs they had worked on in the past. This movement away from Flash occurred when the decline in demand was still nascent and Flash openings were still fairly plentiful.


# Conclusiones

Our main empirical finding is that despite a large reduction in demand for Flash skills, wages changed very little, due in part to how rapidly workers adapted to this change.

The supply of Flash workers proved to be remarkably elastic with no discernible evidence of a decline in wages, in part because of rapid adjustment by the supply side of the market.

The adjustment was rapid because workers were forward-looking about human capital choices.

**Clave esto:**

> In terms of generalizability, our results are derived from a particular context where technological shocks are commonplace, the pace of technological change is quick, and there are relatively few frictions associated with moving to new technologies or employers

Como la tecnología (en software) cambia tan rápido, los desarrolladores estamos más acostumbrados a movernos entre tecnologías.

**Otra clave**

> Our results are consistent with the labor market not being a significant impediment to technology adoption: the “old” skill did not become relatively cheaper, and the price of “new” (at least to Flash workers) skills would (…) fall, as supply increased and/or workers were willing to work at a discount to increase their human capital. If workers quickly move to where the demand will be, the notion of a general skills mismatch seems unlikely

Dice que a pesar del cambio de tecnología, la hora de trabajo en la pronta a ser desfasada NO sería más barata. En cambio, la hora de trabajo de la nueva y en demanda SÍ sería más barata porque habrá más gente buscando O la gente buscando estaría dispuesta a bajar el valor de la hora.

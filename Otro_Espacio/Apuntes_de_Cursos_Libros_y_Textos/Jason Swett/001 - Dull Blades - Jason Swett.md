# Dull Blades por Jason Swett

We know the metaphor of technical debt. I want to share with you a different metaphor. I think this metaphor is a little better than the debt metaphor.

In real life, debt is not bad. If you have debt, it means you took out a loan. Loans are a good thing. Loans are what makes it possible to buy things like cars and houses that almost nobody has the money for up front.

**Debt in real life is also avoidable**. You don't have to get a car loan or mortgage if you don't want to.

==In software, what we call "technical debt" is not avoidable. It's going to happen no matter what==.

Managers talk about "strategic technical debt", (...) debt is consciously taken on in order to meet a short-term timeline. ==The thing is, there's never a plan to pay the debt back==.  *it rarely does get paid back*. (...)next move is to take on yet more technical debt. It's like a payday loan cycle, where each payday loan is used to pay the interest from the last payday loan. ==the "strategic technical debt" myth persists, (...) because the metaphor is easy to grasp==

**I prefer to think of a software system as a ==collection of blades==.**

**A dull blade is never preferable to a sharp one**. (...) it may be better to cut with the dull blade instead of taking the time to sharpen the blade before cutting, but it's clear that that's a compromise.

Unlike debt which you can simply choose not to take on, **blades unavoidably get dull with use**. ==Having technical debt makes it sound like you did something wrong==. But you don't have to do anything wrong in order to end up with bad code. (...) ==bad code is simply the result of rot==.

The blade metaphor also has built-in guidance about how to address the problem. When is it time to sharpen a dull blade? Right before you use it (or right after). ==When you pick up a saw and notice that it's hard to cut with, that can tell you that it would be worth the investment to sharpen it at least a little before trying to cut more with it==.

Lastly, the blade metaphor makes clear the benefit of being in a good state. What exactly is the benefit of not having technical debt? That you don't have to pay technical interest?. ==The benefit of having sharp blades is obvious: you can cut faster==. Unlike being debt-free which is simply the absence of a bad thing, you're in possession of something good.

As an industry I wish we would do away with the technical debt metaphor and adopt the blade metaphor instead. I think this metaphor would help managers understand the nature of the issue more accurately. Instead of pressuring us to take on "strategic technical debt", maybe they'll see the virtues of helping us keep our blades sharp.

# Clean code is downstream of clear thinking por Jason Swett

(...) programmers think of programs as being made out of code. In a sense that's true of course.

But if you really think about it, software systems aren't exactly made out of code. ==They're made out of ideas. The code is just a representation of those ideas==.

If the **ideas that make up the system are sloppy or illogical**, then the code for the system will be sloppy and illogical too.

The quality of the ideas in the system set the upper bound for how good the code can be. The quality of the code can't exceed the quality of the ideas in the system.

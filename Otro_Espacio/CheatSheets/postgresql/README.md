# psql Cheat Sheet

List of commands for managing and using PostgreSQL.

`psql` commands are quite forgettable and I forget them a lot, that is why I decided to arrange them into a cheat sheet for reference.

## Contents

This cheat sheet is divided into sections:

- Installation and config see: [Basics](basics/README.md)
- User/Role setup: [Queries](queries/README.md)
- Commands inside the `psql` shell or backslash(`\`) commands: [PSQL Commands](psql-commands/README.md)
- Dumping, restoring, and managing DBs from your shell/terminal: [Terminal Commands](terminal-commands/README.md)
- [Utilities](utilities/README.md)
- How to fix some weird errors like: dyld, invalid byte sequence, etc: [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/README.md)
- [Advanced](advanced/README.md)

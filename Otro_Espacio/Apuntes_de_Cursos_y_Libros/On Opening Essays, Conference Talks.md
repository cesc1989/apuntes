# Opening Essays and Other Pieces of Narrative Writing

People often start pieces somewhere sensible, but boring. Like the chronological start of a story.

Another bad way to start a piece of writing is with a statement of what you're going to write about, followed by a definition.

You can't write good openings without having good ideas, good arguments, good structure, and good storytelling skills.

## Tense, Paradoxical, and Problematic Openings

Openings need tension – paradoxes, unanswered questions, and unresolved action.

Good openings propose problems, pose questions, drop you into an unfinished story, or point at fundamental tensions within a topic.

he sets up a clear paradox: *our technological advances should have led to fewer working hours, but they haven't. Strange*.

asks a series of rhetorical questions to which the presumed answers is “of course not!”

## Finding Tension, Paradoxes and Problems

Problems are a destabilising condition that has a cost for a community of readers that needs a solution.

## Consequential Problems

suggests we try to state our problem and then ask a series of so what?'s to get at the underlying problem.

For your writing to be worth reading, you need to be exploring something of consequence for someone. You have to have some kind of problem that matters. Even if it's a personal problem like a medical issue, career challenge, or difficult technical bug, you're hopefully writing about it to help others encountering a similar situation.

## Starting in the Middle 

Developing a structure requires navigating the tension between chronology and theme.

Here are two of the opening slides from my  talk:

This outline isn't especially detailed, but now the audience has a map of where we're going. They understand the structure of my argument and can tell what I am and am not going to cover.

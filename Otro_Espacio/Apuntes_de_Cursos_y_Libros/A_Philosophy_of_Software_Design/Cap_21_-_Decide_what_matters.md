# Cap. 21 - Decide what matters

> Structure software systems around the things that matter. For the things that donâ€™t matter as much, try to minimize their impact on the rest of the system.


> Focusing on what is important is also a great life philosophy: identify a few things that matter most to you, and try to spend as much of your energy as possible on those things.

# Cap. 16 - Modifying existing code

> It isn’t possible to conceive the right design for a system at the outset;
> 
> the design of a mature system is determined more by changes made during the system’s evolution than by any initial conception.


## Stay strategic
> if you invest a little extra time to refactor and improve the system design, you’ll end up with a cleaner system.


> **If you’re not making the design better, you are probably making it worse.**


## Maintaining comments: keep the comments near the code
> The best way to ensure that comments get updated is to position them close to the code they describe, so developers will see them when they change the code.
> 
> The farther a comment is from its associated code, the less likely it is that it will be updated properly.

Entre más lejos esté un comentario del código relacionado, menos probable será que se actualice.


> In general, the farther a comment is from the code it describes, the more abstract it should be (this reduces the likelihood that the comment will be invalidated by code changes).

Cuanto más lejos esté un comentario del código que describe, más abstracto deberá ser. Así se reduce la probabilidad de que quede invalidado al cambiar el código.

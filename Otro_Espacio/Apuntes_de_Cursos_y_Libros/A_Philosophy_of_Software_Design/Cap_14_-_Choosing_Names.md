# Cap. 14 - Choosing Names

> you shouldn’t settle for names that are just “reasonably close”. Take a bit of extra time to choose great names, which are precise, unambiguous, and intuitive. The extra attention will pay for itself quickly, and over time you’ll learn to choose good names quickly.


## Create an image
> When choosing a name, the goal is to create an image in the mind of the reader about the nature of the thing being named.


> Names are a form of abstraction: they provide a simplified way of thinking about a more complex underlying entity. Like other forms of abstraction, the best names are those that focus attention on what is most important about the underlying entity while omitting details that are less important.


## Names should be precise
> Good names have two properties: precision and consistency.

**Precision**
The most common problem with names is that they are too generic or vague; as a result, it’s hard for readers to tell what the name refers to;

**Mención a usar nombres de variables de una letra en ciclos**
it’s fine to use generic names like i and j as loop iteration variables, as long as the loops only span a few lines of code. If you can see the entire range of usage of a variable, then the meaning of the variable will probably be obvious from the code so you don’t need a long name. For example, consider the following code:

    for (i = 0; i < numLines; i++) { ... }


**Consistency**

> Consistent naming reduces cognitive load in much the same way as reusing a common class: once the reader has seen the name in one context, they can reuse their knowledge and instantly make assumptions when they see the name in a different context.



## Sobre readability
> readability must be determined by readers, not writers. If you write code with short variable names and the people who read it find it easy to understand, then that’s fine.


## En Resumen
> “The greater the distance between a name’s declaration and its uses, the longer the name should be.” The earlier discussion about using loop variables named i and j is an example of this rule.

Según que tan lejos esté la declaración de una variable a la parte donde se usa, así de largo debe ser el nombre.

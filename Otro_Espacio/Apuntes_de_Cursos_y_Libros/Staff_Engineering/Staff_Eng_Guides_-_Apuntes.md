# Staff Eng Guides - Apuntes

# Staff archetypes
> The **Tech Lead** guides the approach and execution of a particular team.


> The **Architect** is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area.


> The **Solver** digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward.


> The **Right Hand** extends an executive's attention, borrowing their scope and authority to operate particularly complex organizations.
## Tech Lead
> They're comfortable scoping complex tasks, coordinating their team towards solving them, and unblocking them along the way.


> first person called when the roadmap needs to be shuffled.

A esto debería apuntar dentro de Luna


> they will have implemented their team's most complex technical projects, but at this point, they default to delegating


> Being a Staff-engineer is not just a role. It's the intersection of the role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization's recognition
## Architect
> Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company, for example, the company's API design, frontend stack, storage strategy, or cloud infrastructure.
## The Solver
> The Solver is a trusted agent of the organization who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until they're resolved.

En esto podría llegar a convertirme en Luna. Teniendo en cuenta que trabajo en: Forms, Credentialing, Portal, Luxe, Marketplace(+/-). (y en un futuro tal vez Grimoire)


> Folks in this role are moved onto problems identified by organizational leadership as critical and either lacking a clear approach or with a high degree of execution risk.


## Right Hands
> Right Hands often dive into a fire, edit the approach, delegate execution to the most appropriate team, and then pop over to the next fire elsewhere in the organization.
## Conclusions
> The Tech Lead and Architect tend to work with the same people on the same problems for years, developing a tight sense of team and shared purpose.


> The Solver and Right Hand bounce from fire to fire, often having more transactional interactions with the folks they're working with on any given week.
# A forty-year career
> reflecting on the idea that my career is something I can deliberately develop over a forty year horizon.

Esto es un enfoque interesante. Nunca he tenido un enfoque de solo hacer dinero ni de longevidad pero creo que hacer un ejercicio donde apunte a mi carrera en 5-8 años sería beneficioso para mis pretensiones y la forma en que busco trabajar.


> I’d focus on pace, people, prestige, profit and learning.


## Pace
> The biggest barrier to a forty year career is burnout
> 
> (lectura enlazada “[Only you can prevent tech burnout](https://compassionatecoding.com/blog/2016/9/2/only-you-can-prevent-tech-burnout-5-compassionate-tips-for-managers-and-employees))


> work on work you find meaningful. Second, manage your pace.

Estoy de acuerdo en esto. Trabajar en Ruby on Rails, en sistemas de Salud, ha sido lo más recompensante que he podido experimentar. 

También tengo que gestionar mejor el ritmo de gasto de energía al trabajar en los proyectos personales o sino m pasará lo del 2021.


> To work at a pace I could sustain, instead of a blitz.


> the quality of your overall work is going to mirror your mental health.


> building continued depth and expertise requires remaining in the same environment for multiple years.


> formula for checking if what you’re doing is sustainable: how long does it take on a vacation or weekend until you stop feeling anxious, and how anxious do you start feeling when you think about returning to work on Monday?

En este aspecto estoy bien. El ritmo de Luna lo permite y es la forma de trabajo más común en Ideaware.


> your success depends on sustained impact, not spikes.


## People
> found increasingly true is that your current coworkers also have an outsized influence on your career long after you’ve stopped working together.


> They’ll be the **folks who enter you through the streamlined referral process**. They’ll be the folks you can trust when they tell you about a company’s culture. They’ll be the folks that suggest your name for an important role. They’ll give you advice on difficult situations.

Clave quedar en buenos términos con todo compañero de trabajo, además de impresionarlos con mi trabajo y dedicación.

Que mi trabajo hable bien de mí con todo mundo.

## Prestige
> you’ll have to develop your own prestige to gain access to those scarce opportunities and resources.


> there are accessible forms of prestige that you can build through deliberate, hard work.

Blog.
¿debería buscar participar en un podcast?
Los meetups.
¿Debería considerar hacer algún tipo de transmisión/grabación como Jason Swett o Kasper?

## Profit
> folks I’ve worked with have encountered ageism as well, finding that folks are less and less interested in hiring them as they get more experienced.

Aquí es importante pensar en el plan de los 40 años. DevAsPros y/o escritura o enseñanza. 


> The key here isn’t “getting rich”, but creating the flexibility for yourself and the folks who depend on you, because that flexibility allows you to be deliberate about creating opportunities to invest into yourself and your career.


> Financial security is a prerequisite to own your pace and learning.

Así es. Con eso se pueden hacer otras cosas con facilidad y menos preocupaciones.

## Learning
> described **spending four hours a week thinking about the future**. Each week, their thinking would compound on the previous week’s, letting them see further and further into the future.

Interesante ejercicio.


> Each year identify one or two new things–things that you’re uncomfortable with–and do them! You’ll continue growing yourself, adding more and more pieces to your toolkit.

Dentro del plan de carrera de 40 años.


> You don’t need to do everything new each year, but do enough to maintain your habit of learning.


> learning doesn’t come just from doing new things. It also requires time carved out to reflect on how you did those new things and how you might adjust your future approach.

Muy importante. 

# Work on What Matters
> Only through [pacing your career to your life](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/) can you sustain yourself for the long-term.


> pacing yourself becomes the central challenge of a sustained, successful career


## Avoid Snacking

> ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments

Como el artículo que leí sobre tener tiempo muerto o “slack” en [“Efficiency is the enemy”](https://fs.blog/slack/).

Hay que producir pero no siempre se puede estar produciendo.


> keep yourself honest about how much time you're spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work.

Hay que balancear. Como nos está guiando Jason. Trabajo de valor pero también O&Ms.

## Stop Preening
> Preening is doing low-impact, high-visibility work.
## Stop Chasing Ghosts
> As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing in meaningless work on a grand scale.

Uno no debe llegar a un sitio nuevo a arreglar todo sino lo que en realidad necesite arreglarse.

## Work where there's room and attention
> the most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work.

Aquí el autor dice que hay que buscar trabajo de impacto pero donde no todo el mundo tenga la vista. Eso hará que, una vez completo y andando, tenga mayor impacto.


> always a great deal of room to do this sort of work that no one is paying attention to, so you'll be able to make rapid initial progress on it, which feels like a good opportunity to invest.


> Your early wins will slowly get eroded by indifference and misalignment, and your initial impact will be reclaimed by the sands of time.

En todo caso hay que hacer ese trabajo porque era importante hacerlo.


> Teaching a company to value something it doesn't care about is the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less.
## Edit
> you can often shift a project's outcomes by investing the smallest ounce of effort, and this is some of the most valuable work you can do.
## Finish Things
> getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage.


> Time spent getting work finished is always time well spent.
## Why it matters
> focus on work that matters, do projects that develop you, and steer towards companies that value genuine experience.


# Staying aligned with authority
> What's bestowed can also be retracted, and retaining organizational authority depends on 
> remaining deeply aligned with the bestowing sponsor
## Beyond the safety net
> Now you are one of the people responsible for setting the company, your team, and your manager up for success.

En posiciones de liderazgo, la clave es hacer que todo mi entorno sea exitoso. Si ellos lo son, yo lo seré.


> Staff-plus roles are leadership roles, and in leadership roles, the support system that got you here will fade away.


> you're now expected to align the pieces around you for your own success.


## Serving at the pleasure of the President
> it's valuable to develop your own approach to aligning upward with your manager.

**Never surprise your manager**

> treat each time you surprise your manager as an incident to be learned from and endeavor to prevent repeats.

**Don’t let your manager surprise you**

> you should also take proactive action to facilitate information flow.

**Feed your manager’s context**

> Be clear that you're not bringing them a problem to solve, rather conveying information you believe will be useful.
> Opinions are helpful, but even more helpful is data when you can find it.


## Influencing without too much friction
> Part of growing as a leader is developing your own perspective on how the world should work, and you can't reach the Staff-plus level without that perspective.


> Having a clear sense of how things ought to work sharpens your judgment and enables you to act proactively.


> recommend sharpening your awareness of the distinctions between the values that you hold and those that the organization operates under


# Manage Technical Quality
> engineers, engineering managers, and technology executives are likely to agree on, it's that there's a crisis of technical quality.


## The Problem
> As an engineering leadership team, your goal is to maintain an appropriate technical quality level while devoting as much energy as possible towards the core business.

Just as your company's technical quality bar will shift over time, your approach to managing technical quality will evolve in tandem:

1. fix the **hot spots** that are causing immediate problems
2. adopt **best practices** that are known to improve quality
3. prioritize **leverage points** that preserve quality as your software changes
4. align **technical vectors** in how your organization changes software
5. **measure technical quality** to guide deeper investment
6. spin up a **technical quality team** to create systems and tools for quality
7. run a **quality program** to measure, track and create accountability


> Technical quality is a long-term game. There's no such thing as winning, only learning and earning the chance to keep playing.
## Ascending the staircase
> it's generally most effective to start with the lightest weight solutions and only progress towards massive solutions as earlier efforts collapse under the pressure of scale.


> So, do the quick stuff first!

En cuanto a mejorar la calidad.


> Even if it doesn't work, you'll learn more and more quickly from failing to roll out the easy stuff than failing to roll out the hard stuff.


> Premature processes add more friction than value and are quick to expose themselves as ineffective.
## Hot spots
> Alternatively, maybe you're better served by acknowledging that your software design is error-prone and adopting the "define errors out of existence" approach described in A Philosophy of Software Design.


> maybe you can just delete the one test file where 98% of test failures happen. That's the unreasonable effectiveness of prioritizing hot spots and why it should be the first technique you use to improve technical quality.
## Best practices
> Adopting best practices requires a level of organizational and leadership maturity that takes some time to develop.
## Leverage points
> the worst sin of performance engineering is applying effort to unproven problems.
## Technical vectors
> **Encapsulate your approach in your workflows and tooling.** Documentation of a clear vision is helpful, but some folks simply won't study your document. Deliberate tools create workflows that nurture habits far better than training and documentation.
## Measure technical quality
> it is possible to usefully measure code quality, and it comes down to developing an extremely precise definition of quality.


> The more detailed you can get your definition of quality, the more useful it becomes to measure a codebase, and the more instructive it becomes to folks hoping to improve the quality of the area they're working on.
## Start small and add slowly
> you find yourself struggling with technical quality--and we all do, frequently--then start with something small, and iterate on it until it works.


> Slowly build towards something that genuinely works


> When it comes to complex systems and interdependencies, moving quickly is just optics. It's methodical movement that gets the job done.
# Writing Engineering Strategy
> The reality is that good engineering strategy is boring and that it's easier to write an effective strategy than a bad one.


> To write an engineering strategy, write five design documents, and pull the similarities out. That's your engineering strategy.
## When and why
> Strategies allow everyone (…) to make quick, confident decisions that might have otherwise cost them a week of discussion.
## Write five design docs
> A good design document describes a specific problem, surveys possible solutions, and explains the selected approach's details.

Sobre un design doc. Para tener en cuenta.

**Cuando escribir un design doc**

> You should write design documents for any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects.


> You should also write design documents for projects that meaningfully impact your users.


> You should write a design document for any work taking more than a month of engineering time.

**Recommendations**
**Start from the problem.**

> The clearer the problem statement, the more obvious the solutions.

**Keep the template simple.**

> Prefer minimal design document templates that allow authors to select the most useful sections and only insist on exhaustive details for the riskiest projects.

**Gather and review together, write alone.**

> Gather perspectives widely but write alone.

**Prefer good over perfect.**

> It's better to write a good document and get it in front of others than it is to delay for something marginally better.


> as you become more senior, it's toxic to push every design to meet the bar of your own best work.
# What do Staff engineers actually do?
> main focus is working on projects/efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team.


## Setting technical direction
> constant across all roles is that the reality of setting technical direction is far more about understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you and far less about prioritizing technology and approaches that you personally are excited to learn


## Providing engineering perspective
> are the folks who will often get unexpectedly pulled into the room where this sort of decision is happening. This gives them the opportunity to inject the engineering context and perspective into a decision while it's still possible to change the outcome.


## But will you still write software?
> Even if you're not writing much, you'll be reading a ton of your coworkers' code and doing a fair number of code reviews.

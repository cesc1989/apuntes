Esta es la verdadera representación de MVP.

- The picture is a metaphor. It is not about actual car development, it is about product development in general, using a car as a metaphor.
- Many projects fail badly because they do Big Bang delivery (build the thing until 100% done and deliver at the end)
- the first row represents “bastardized agile”. Technically it might be incremental and iterative delivery, but the absence of an actual feedback loop makes it very risky – **and definitely not agile**.

Lo importante de agil es ciclos cortos JUNTO a retroalimentación continua.


- Instead we **focus on the underlying need the customer wants fulfilled**
- **we’re not trying to make the customer happy at this point**(first iteration). We might make a few early adopters happy… our **main goal at this point is just to** ***learn***

Por eso la retroalimentación. Así se aprende y se dirigen los esfuerzos hacía donde se quiere.


- The key question is “**What is the cheapest and fastest way we can start learning?**”
> You don’t need to test the product on all users, and you don’t need to build a product to test something. **Testing a prototype on even a single user will teach you more than nothing.**


- But **in the meantime he is actually using this product, and giving us feedback**.
> But in most real-life product development scenarios I’ve seen, **no matter how much up-front analysis you do, you’re still surprised when you put the first real release into the hands of a real user**, and many of your assumptions turn out to be way off.

Así es. Una cosa son las ideas en papel en el día 1 y pasados 100 días pueden llegar nuevas ideas o al cliente ya no le interesa la idea original.


- However, most product development efforts I’ve seen are much too complex and risky for that, and the big bang approach all too often leads to huge expensive failures.
- **Think of the skateboard as a metaphor for the smallest thing you can put in the hands of real users, and get real feedback**.

# How to Perform Inception on Your Customers

La Propuesta de Valor: qué hace único tu producto y cómo ayudará a tus clientes.

- In a startup, just like with inception, you must start with the most basic value your business creates
- In business, the absolute basic form of your idea is called a **value proposition:** what is the biggest pain your company solves and how?
- The most common mistake startups make is assume that the value proposition is about their product. It is not, it’s about the customer and how you are going to make their lives better
- **your value proposition should never describe your product’s features. Instead, it should describe how your customer’s life is going to be awesome once they use your product.**


# An MVP is not a Cheaper Product, It’s about Smart Learning

- A minimum viable product (MVP) is not always a smaller/cheaper version of your final product.
- Defining the goal for a MVP can save you tons of time, money and grief.
- Think about cheap hacks to test the goal


# How to define and prioritize features for your MVP

- the top two reasons for failure are **No Market Need (42%)** and **Ran out cash (29%)**.
- Both of these reasons highlight just how important it is that your company builds only what is necessary.

El objetivo final de un MVP

> The goal of your minimum viable product (MVP) should be to prove there is product market fit while taking on the least amount of risk possible. **Founders are often overly excited about their ideas and eager to start building features without proper planning**. They may gloss over assumptions they are making, both about their product and their customers.


- During the earliest stages of your company, it is especially important to talk to your potential customers and gain insight as to how they might use your product.


- There are a number of important questions you should be able to answer in order to reduce the risk of building a product without market fit
    - **“What problem does my product solve?”**: *It is surprisingly easy to come up with solutions to problems that don’t actually exist*
    - **“Who is having this problem?”**: *Be as precise as possible because in the early stages you’re not going to be be able to build a product for everyone*
    - **“How big of a problem is this?”**: *Just because your potential customers are having a problem, doesn’t mean that it is enough of a pain point for them to use your product*
    - **“How are people solving this problem now?”**: *You might find out that there is actually a way bigger problem that your product doesn’t address and it would be better to focus your efforts on solving that problem instead*
    - **“What is your value statement?”**: *should clearly explain how your company/product is uniquely equipped to solve this problem and what separates you from your competition*

Distinguish between must-haves and nice-to-haves

- Ask yourself: does this feature need to be included to validate your product? Does it align with your value statement?
- Remember that your goal is to build the absolute minimum needed to validate your product idea while taking on as little risk as possible.

Aprende de la retroalimentación y continua iterando

- It’s important to remind yourself that your MVP is not the final version, nor will there ever be a *final* version


> Instagram is a great example of successful iteration based on listening to customer feedback. It started as a location sharing app with a picture sharing feature. Fast forward to present day and they’ve created a new social media category based solely around picture sharing - what their customers really wanted.


# I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead

[Artículo](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html).
The motivation behind the MVP is still valid:

1. Build something small, because small things are predictable and inexpensive to test.
2. Get it into the market quickly, because real learning occurs only when real customers are using a real product.
3. Trash it if it’s a flop, or invest if it’s a seedling with potential.

Los usuarios odian los MVPs.

- Customers want *great* products they can use *now*.

Simple

> In order for the product to be small and delivered quickly, it has to be **simple**. Customers accept simple products every day. Even if it doesn’t do everything needed, as long as the product never claimed to do more than it does, customers are forgiving.

Complete

> “Simple” is good, “incomplete” is not. The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product, as-is. Not because it’s version 0.1 of something complex, but because it’s version 1.0 of something simple.

Lovable

> People have to want to use it. Products that do less but are loved, are more successful than products which have more features, but that people dislike.

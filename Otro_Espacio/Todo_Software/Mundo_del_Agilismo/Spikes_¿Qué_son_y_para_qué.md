# Spikes: ¿Qué son y para qué?

# Agile Spikes Deliver Knowledge So Teams Can Deliver Products
> What is a spike? In agile projects, a **spike** refers to a time-boxed research activity that helps teams make better decisions & deliver better products. (…) spikes give teams technical and functional information they need to make decisions about the best approach to certain user stories.

# How We Do Spikes

> I like to define it as “time dedicated to investigate and document”. Basically, answering those questions will mitigate risks and reduce uncertainty.


> they get an amount of time. It could be half an hour or two days. It’s what is reasonable to invest in


> So, we know how much time to spend on a spike and when, but what will be produced? Since the work done in a spike is about searching, trying and making mistakes, it is very important and valuable to everyone to **document** the progress. When a spike is left there because we ran out of time, we should be able to come back to it and see what has been done in detail.


## The Three Questions to Answer
- What is the problem that we want to solve?
- Is it feasible?
- How much effort does it need?


## Documentation guidelines

**Write a summary of what’s been discussed**

> to communicate what motivated to get into that spike

**Document your steps**

> Document what were your alternatives, why you made the decision and how that will affect (positively and potentially negatively) the team and the project. That will also be useful if the spike runs out of time and we want to come back to it later. That important knowledge won’t depend on one developer’s memory.

**Answer the three questions explicitly**

> The goal is to answer them. So write them down in a way that is easy to spot immediately.

**Abuse your tools**

> Your documentation should be easy to find. You should not try to over engineer the flow and lose time just to start documenting.
